This is because hydrogen is the raw fuel that many stars throughout the universe burn to produce energy in a process known as fusion. The sun is an example of a hydrogen-burning star. It has about 5 billion years' worth of fuel left.\n\nHydrogen is a commercially important element on Earth. Large amounts of hydrogen combine with nitrogen in the air to form ammonia (NH3), commonly used in cleaning products. This formation of ammonia is called the Haber-Bosch process, named after German chemists Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch. Hydrogen is also found in many fats and oils through a process known as hydrogenation. Liquid hydrogen is used in the study of superconductors and, along with liquid oxygen, in rocket fuel.\n\nHydrogen combines with various other elements on Earth to form several different molecules. For example, water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O), methane is made of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms (CH4), and table sugar is made of twelve carbon atoms, twenty-two hydrogen atoms, and eleven oxygen atoms (C12H22O11). While hydrogen has only two known stable isotopes, hydrogen has three known isotopes altogether. The first and simplest isotope, protium, is just pure hydrogen. The second isotope, deuterium, was discovered in 1932. The last isotope, tritium, was discovered in 1934.";

It was discovered on the sun when French Astronomer Pierre-Jules-Cesar Janssen noticed a yellow line in the sun's spectrum while studying a total solar eclipse in 1868. Meanwhile, English astronomer Sir Norman Lockyer saw that this line had a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers, and that a wavelength of this size could not be produced at any known element at the time. It was hypothesized that a new element was at work creating the emission that led to the yellow line. Lockyer named this unknown element helium.\n\nHelium is the second most abundant element in our known universe behind hydrogen. It forms in stars when two hydrogen atoms combine to form one helium atom in what is called fusion. Helium is much less abundant in Earth's atmosphere; it makes up approximately 0.0005% of the air we breathe. The helium on Earth is not gravitationally bound to the planet and is constantly being lost to space. The lost helium is replaced by the decay of radioactive elements in the Earth's crust. The type of radioactive decay that creates alpha particles that will eventually become new helium atoms is called alpha decay. When these alpha particles capture two electrons to become helium, they work their way to the top of the atmosphere and into space as the cycle repeats again.\n\nIt is very difficult to extract helium gas from the air, but there are natural gas deposits that are rich in helium. Helium gas is used in blimps and many different types of balloons to keep them afloat. It is used as an inert shield for welding, fuel pressurization in liquid-fueled rockets, and in supersonic tunnels. Along with oxygen, helium helps create a a nitrogen-free atmosphere for deep sea divers to prevent a condition called nitrogen narcosis. In liquid form, helium is used for studying superconductivity and creating supercondictive magnets.\n\nSince helium is an inert gas, it does not easily combine with other elements, and because it does not combine with other elements easily, there are no known compounds that contain helium. However, despite its inert state, attempts are being made at producing a compound called helium diflouride (HeF2).";

Lithium only makes up 0.0007% of the Earth's crust, and it cannot be found free in nature. To obtain pure lithium, you would have to run large amounts of lithium chloride (LiCl) through electrolysis to separate the lithium and chlorine that make up this compound.\n\nLithium and compounds containing lithium have several different uses in producing different stuff. This is because lithium has the highest specific heat of any solid element and is also the lightest and least dense known metal. Because it has such high heat capacity, lithium is commonly used in heat transfer applications. It is used to make special types of glasses and ceramics, including a 200-inch mirror that is used on the Mount Palomar telescope in California. Because lithium is so light, it can be alloyed with other light metals such as aluminum, copper, manganese, and cadmium for strong, lightweight materials for aircraft. Lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is used for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of spacecraft, lithium stearate (LiC18H35O2) is used as a lubricant for high-temperature environments, and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) is used as a drug for treating manic depression disorder (although its action on the brain is still not yet fully understood).\n\nPerhaps the most important role of lithium is its use in rechargeable batteries found in mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras, and electric vehicles. Lithium is also used in non-rechargeable batteries seen in pacemakers, toys, clocks, and almost anything else electronic.\n\nLithium is a toxic metal, but not in very small doses, and it reacts violently with water, though not as much as sodium.";

Today, pure beryllium can be obtained through beryl (Be3Al2(SiO3)6) via a chemical process or through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten beryllium chloride (BeCl2) and sodium chloride (NaCl).\n\nBeryllium is used to make windows for X-ray tubes due to it being relatively transparent to X-rays. Beryllium is alloyed with copper to form a wear-resistant metal known as beryllium bronze for use in gyroscopes and other devices where wear-resistance is important. When it is alloyed with nickel, on the other hand, it can be used to make springs, spot-welding electrodes, and non-sparking tools. Other beryllium alloys are used for windshields, brake disks, and other space shuttle components.

Borax, at one point, was also used in bleach and as a food preservative. Boric oxide is used in making borosilicate glass, or Pyrex, because it makes the glass tougher to break and more resistant to heat. Other compounds containing boron are used as enamels for covering steel and as a potential arthritis medicine and brain tumor treatment.\n\nBoron is essential for the cell walls in plants, and it is typically nonpoisonous to animals in small doses, but it can disrupt the body's metabolism if consumed in higher amounts. The average human consumes around 2 milligrams of boron every day from our food, which adds up to around 60 grams in our lifetime.

Carbon is most easily obtainable from coal deposits, but it usually must be processed into a form that is suitable for commercial use. There are three naturally occurring allotropes of carbon currently known to exist: amorphous, graphite, and diamond.\n\nAmorphous carbon forms when a material containing carbon is burned with not enough oxygen to burn completely. The black soot that forms from this is called carbon black, but it is also referred to as lampblack, gas black, and channel black. Carbon black is used for making inks, paints, and rubber products. It can also be pressed into shapes to form the cores of most dry cell batteries.\n\nGraphite is the softest naturally occurring form of carbon, so it is primarily used as a lubricant. To get this form of carbon, industries treat petroleum coke, which is a black tar residue that remains after refining crude oil, in an oxygen-free-oven. Graphite, in addition to its use as a lubricant, is also used to produce steel, and as the black material inside pencils.\n\nDiamond is the third naturally-occurring form of carbon, and is one of the hardest known substances. Naturally-occurring diamons is typically used in jewelry, but most commercial quality diamonds are produced artificially. Artificial diamonds are created by squeezing graphite under very high temperatures for many days or weeks and are primarily used for making diamond-tipped saw blades. The only difference between graphite and diamond is the crystal structure that they have.\n\nThere is a fourth allotrope of carbon called white carbon that was produced in 1969. It is a transparent material that can split a single beam of light in two, a property called birefringence. Despite this form of carbon being created about half a century ago, little is actually known about it.\n\nThere are, and I kid you not, a whopping ten million compounds of carbon known to mankind. So many, in fact, that there is an entire branch of chemistry reserved exclusively for their study, called organic chemistry. Some of these well-known carbon compounds include carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon disulfide (CS2), chloroform (CHCl3), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), acetylene (C2H2), benzene (C6H6), ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH), and acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n\nBecause carbon is essential to life, it is relatively nontoxic. Many living things get the vast majority of their carbon from carbon dioxide, either from the air or dissolved in water. Plants and photosynthetic plankton use the sun's energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere and the water, while the hydrogen joins with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates.\n\n(Note: Any element's numeric data that has an output of 0 means that this data for the element is unknown.)";

This ammonia is then used to make fertilizers, explosives, and, from the Ostwald process, named after German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald, nitric acid (HNO3).\n\nNitrogen gas is largely inert and is used as a protective shield during the production of semiconductors, welding, and soldiering operations. In the oil industry, to help force crude oil to the surface, nitrogen is applied at very high pressures. Liquid notrogen is a cryogenic liquid used for refeigeration, preservation of biological samples, and low-temperature science experiments.\n\nNitrogen is recycled naturally by living organisms via the 'nitrogen cycle'. The nitrogen is taken in by plants and algae as nitrates and is then used to construct DNA and RNA bases, as well as amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Meanwhile, animals get their nitrogen from consuming other living things. They digest the proteins and DNA into their bases and amino acids, reforming them into their use. Microbes in the soil convert the nitrogen compounds back into nitrates for plants to use again, and the nitrate supply is also replenished by bacteria that fixes the nitrogen directly from the atmosphere.\n\nFinally, crop yields can be increased greatly by adding chemical fertilizers containing nitrogen to the soil, but if they are used carelessly or in excess, the fertilizer can leach out of the soil and seep into rivers and lakes, causing algae to grow quickly. This blocks out light and prevents photosynthesis, and the lake or river dies as a result.";

The gas that was produced from the heated oxide was called 'dephlogisticated' or 'fire' air before French chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier officially gave it the name oxygen after incorrectly believing that it was necessary to form all acids.\n\nOxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe behind hydrogen and helium, and makes up almost 21% of the Earth's atmosphere. Oxygen accounts for nearly half of the Earth's crust, two-thirds of the human body, and nine-tenths of water, all three of which are relative to mass. Fractional distillation is a process used to extract large amounts of oxygen from liquefied air, and the heating of potassium chloride (KClO3) is another way of producing pure oxygen.\n\nOxygen is highly reactive and can combine with many other elements. It is used in many forms of combustion and for burning fuels. It is also used with high pressures to burn away impurities in pig iron to create steel. When used with acetylene (C2H2), it produces a white hot flame used for welding. Liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen makes excellent fuel for rockets. Ozone (O3) forms a thin layer in the lower stratosphere that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.\n\nToday, oxygen is needed for most species on Earth to breathe, but long ago, at the beginning of the Proterozoic Eon, that was a completely different story -- it was a poison for nearly all forms of life at that time. If you could travel back in time to 2.4 billion years before you were born, you would be in for a horrible surprise: You would suffocate within minutes because there was very little oxygen back then. The atmosphere at the time was composed almost entirely out of nitrogen -- about 98% to be more exact. Oxygen first appeared during this time due to cyanobacteria releasing it into the air as a waste product from photosynthesis. The mass accumulation of oxygen into the atmosphere became known as the Great Oxygenation event, one of the most important events in Earth's history.

Fluorine never occurs pure in nature and wass very difficult for scientists to isolate. The first time pure fluorine was obtained was when British chemist George Gore ran an electric current through hydrofluoric acid (HF). The fluorine gas that was created from the electrolysis reacted violently with the hydrogen gas that came out on in its electrode. Years later, fluorine was successfully isolated through the electrolysis of potassium fluoride (KF) and hydrofluoric acid. Today, fluorine is also obtained through the electrolysis of potassium acid fluoride (KHF2).\n\nTo prevent tooth decay, fluorine is added to city water in about a one part per million proportion. In toothpaste, sodium fluoride (NaF) and sodium monofluorophosphate (NaPO3F) are also used for preventing tooth decay. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used to etch glass, including most of the glass that is used in lightbulbs.\n\nFluorine compounds with carbon to form what are known as fluorocarbons. Dichlorofluoromethane (CF2Cl2), a notable example of a fluorocarbon, was used widespread in air conditioning and refrigeration systems and aerosol sprays in the late 1800s and early 1900s. There was just one problem with using this compound: While it was non-toxic to humans, it was extremely harmful to the ozone layer. At one point, it got so bad that a huge hole in the ozone layer formed above Antarctica. As a result, in 1987, 27 countries came together and signed a global environmental treaty called the Montreal Protocol to reduce the 1986 production levels of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), as they were known as by then, by 50% before the year 2000. An amendment to the treaty in 1990 called for the elimination of all CFC productions by 2000.";

Today, magnesium is extracted from the minerals dolomite (CaCO3 * MGCO3) and carnallite (KCl * MgCl2 * 6H2O), but it is most commonly obtained from seawater, as every cubic mile of seawater contains around 12 billion pounds of magnesium (in metric units, that's around 1.3 billion kilograms for every cubic kilometer).\n\nSince magnesium burns with a bright white light, it is commonly used in fireworks, flares and photographic flashbulbs. Magnesium is alloyed with aluminum often because it makes aluminum easier to shape, and this alloy is used where strong, lightweight materials are required, such as in airplanes, missiles, and rockets. Other items made from magnesium alloys include cameras, horseshoes, baseball masks, and snowshoes.\n\nIn 1618, in Epsom, England, a farmer discovered hydrated magnesium sulphate (MgSO4 * 7H2O) when his cows refused to drink the water from a mineral well nearby. The farmer tasted the water and found it very bitter, but he also noticed that it helped heal actatches and rashes on his skin. Epsom salt, as the sulphate in the water became known as, is used today for treating minor skin abrasions and injuries. Other mangesium compounds include magnesium carbonate (MgCO3), which is used for making certain types of paints and inks, and magnesium fluoride (MgF2), which is applied to optical lenses to reduce glare and reflections.\n\nMagnesium is an essential element in both plant and animal life. Chlorophyll is a magnesium-centered porphyrin complex, and without magnesium, photosynthesis would not happen, and neither will life on Earth. In humans, magnesium is important for hundreds of enzymes to work. The average human body stores about 20 grams of magnesium, mainly in the bones.";

More years passed with easier and more efficient ways of producing pure aluminum, and after a process that French chemist Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville came up with to improve on German chemist Friedrich Wohler's process, the price of aluminum dropped from about $1200 a kilogram in 1852 to about $40 a kilogram in 1859. However, aluminum still remained too expensive to be used on a widespread basis.\n\nIn the 1880s, two important developments greatly increased the availability of aluminum. The first was a new process of obtaining aluminum from aluminum oxide, developed by American chemist Charles Martin Hall and French chemist Paul L.T. Heroult independently. The second was another process, this time involving the separation of aluminum from bauxite, which is an ore that contains a large amount of aluminum hydroxide (Al2O3 * 3H2O) and other aluminum compounds. This process was developed by Austrian chemist Karl Joseph Bayer in 1888. Both processes are still used to this day for almost all of the world's aluminum. By 1909, about 41,000 kilograms of aluminum was produced a day by the Aluminum Company of America, or Alcoa, resulting in the price of aluminum falling to about $0.60 a kilogram.\n\nToday, aluminum is used in a variety of products, including cans, foils, and utensils, and in airplanes, rockets, and other things requiring materials that are strong and light. Although it is not as good of an electrical conductor as copper, it is still being used in electrical transmission lines because of its light weight. Aluminum oxide is also used for making synthetic rubies and sapphires for lasers\n\nAluminum has no known role in biology, but aluminum can accumulate in the body, and a link to Alzheimer's disease has been proposed but not yet confirmed nor denied.";

Red phosphorus is formed when white phosphorus is either heated to 250 degrees C (482 degrees F) or exposed to direct sunlight. Red phosphorus is not as toxic as white phosphorus, but too much friction could change it back to white phosphorus. Red phosphorus is used in safety matches, fireworks, smoke bombs, and pesticides. Black phosphorus is also formed from heating white phosphorus, but a mercury catalyst and a seed crystal of black phosphorus is required to do so. Since black phosphorus is the least reactive of the allotropes, there are no significant commercial uses for it.\n\nPhosphorus compounds are useful in many ways, such as phosphoric acid (H3PO4) in soft drinks and triple superphosphate fertilizer (Ca(H2PO4)2 * H2O) for many plants. Trisodium phosphate (Na3PO4) is used as a cleaning agent and a water softener, and calcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2) is used for making china and producing baking powder.

Most of the sulfur produced today comes from underground deposits found near most salt deposits.\n\nSulfur has three allotropic forms: orthorhrombic, monoclinic, and amorphous. The othorhombic form is the most stable of the three sulfur allotropes. Monoclinic sulfur only exists when its temperature is between 96C and 119C and reverts back to orthorhombic form when cooled. Amorphous sulfur forms when molten sulfur is quickly cooled, but it eventually reverts back to orthorhombic form after some time.\n\nMost of the sulfur that is produced today is used in the manufacture of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).

So dangerous is chlorine, in fact, that during World War I, it was used as a chemical weapon by the Germans starting on April 22, 1915.

To prevent the potassium from reacting with the oxygen and water in the air, pure potassium is usually stored under mineral oil\n\nAs an alloy with sodium, potassium is used in heat transfer in some types of nuclear reactors. It forms a compound with chlorine to form potassium chloride (KCl), used in fertilisers, as salt substitutes, and to produce other chemicals. It compounds with hydrogen, carbon, aqnd oxygen to form potassium carbonate (KHCO3), or pearl ash, to make certain types of glass and soaps. Potassium superoxide creates oxygen from water vapor (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), so it is used in respiratory equipment. Potassium nitrate (KNO3) is used in match heads and pyrotechnic equipment.\n\nPotassium is an essential element to life. Potassium ions are present in all cells because it helps maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Plant cells are particularly rich in potassium, which they get mainly from the soil. On average, humans consume about 7 grams of potassium a day, and store around 140 grams in body cells.

In construction, copper is used to make roofing and plumbine materials. In the compound copper sulfate (CuSO4 * H2O), also called blue vitriol, is used as an agricultural poison, an algicide for water purification, and a blue pigment for inks. Copper chloride (CuCl2), another copper compound, is used to fix dyes to fabrics. Cuprous chloride (CuCl) is a poisonous white powder used for absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2). Copper cyanide (CuCN) is used often for electroplating.\n\nCopper is an essential element for the human body because it helps enzymes trasfer energy in cells, but in excess, copper is toxic.";

Metallic zinc was first produced in the 1400s in India by using wool to heat the mineral calamine (ZnCO3). It was later produced by heating calamine with charcoal. Most of today's zinc is produced through the electrolysis of aqueous zinc sulfate (ZnSO4).\n\nAbout a third of all metallic zinc is produced through a process called galvinization, in which something that is subject to corrosion, such as an iron nail, is given a protective zinc coating. The coating is applied either by dipping it in a pool of molten zinc or most commonly by electroplating. Metallic zinc is used for making dry cell batteries, roof cladding, and die castings.\n\nZinc is also used to make several useful alloys. For example, brass, an alloy of zinc containing between 55% and 95% copper, was first used about 2,500 years ago by the Romans to make coins, kettles, and ornamental items. Brass is widely used today for making musical instruments, screws, and other corrosion resistant hardware. Soldier, an alloy containing zinc, lead, and tin, has a relatively low melting point and is used for joining electrical components, pipes, and other items. Nickel silver, typewriter metal, spring brass, and German silver are other examples of zinc alloys.\n\nZinc oxide (ZnO), a common compound of zinc, is formed when metallic zinc is exposed to the air and forms a coating that protects the rest of the metal. Zinc oxide is used in paints, certain rubber products, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, plastics, printing inks, soap, batteries, and many other things. Zinc sulfide (ZnS), another compound containing zinc, glows when it is exposed to ultraviolet light, X-rays, or electrons and is therefore used to make luminous watch dials, TV screens, and fluorescent light bulbs. Zinc chloride (ZnCl2) protects wood from decay and insects.\n\nZinc is essential for all known living things because it forms the active site in over 20 metallo-enzymes. On average, the human body has about 2.5 grams of zinc and takes in about 15 milligrams a day. Most of the zinc we take in comes from beef, sunflower seeds, and cheese. In excess, however, zinc can be carcinogenic because if newly formed zinc oxide is inhaled, a disorder called the 'oxide shakes' or 'zinc chills' can happen.";

The brighter the light is, the better selenium's conductivity. As a result, selenium is used in devices that respond to the intensity of light, such as electric eyes, photo cells, light meters for cameras, and photo copiers. Selenium can also produce electricity from sunlight and is therefore used in solar cells. In addition to being used in electrical devices, selenium is also used to make the ruby-red color in glasses and enamels, as a photographic toner, and as a stainless steel additive.\n\nSelenium does not form many inorganic compounds, and none of them are commercially important.

In 1734, samples of the mineral columbite ((Fe, Mn, Mg)(Nb, Ta)2O6) were sent to the British Museum in London, England. The columbite sat in the museum for years until it was analyzed. Upon analysis, there was an unknown element in the columbite, but it could not be isolated. The new element was known as columbium.\n\nIn 1809, English chemist and physicist William Hyde Wollaston compared the minerals columbite and tantalite ((Fe, Mn)(Ta, Nb)2O6) and declared that columbium was actually tantalum. This created confusion because tantalum and niobium are similar metals that are always found together and very difficult to isolate from their compounds.\n\nIn 1844, niobium was rediscovered when Heinrich Rose produced niobic acid and pelopic acid from samples of columbite and tantalite. Since these acids were very similar to each other, it would take until about 1866 when Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac proved that the acids were produced from very different elements. Metallic niobium was finally isolated in 1864 by Swedish chemist Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand. Today, niobium is primarily obtained from the minerals columbite and pyrochlore ((Ca, Na)2Nb2O6(O, OH, F)).\n\nNiobium is used as an alloying agent and jewelry, but because of its superconductivity, it is made as an alloy with titanium to make superconductive magnets and wires. Niobium-tin and niobium-aluminum alloys are superconductive as well, so they are used in similar applications.";

Because cesium is easily ionized and has a high mass, it could also one day be used as a propellant in ion engines in spacecraft.\n\nBeing an alkali metal, cesium reacts violently with water, forming cesium hydroxide (CsOH). Cesium hydroxide is the strongest known base and will not be held well with glass. However, cesium chloride (CsCl) and cesium nitrate (CsNO3) are cesium's most common compounds and are primarily used in producing other chemicals.\n\nCesium does not have any known roles in biology.

Dysprosium oxide (Dy2O3), a compound of dysprosium, is used with nickel as an additive to a special cement used for cooling nuclear reactor rods. Other compounds of dysprosium include dysprosium fluoride (DyF3), dysprosium iodide (DyI3) and dysprosium sulfate (Dy2(SO4)3).\n\nDysprosium has no known roles in biology. Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic by ingestion, while insoluble salts are non-toxic. Approximately 500 grams of toxic dysprosium salts are needed to put a normal person's life at risk.";

Platinum is also used in the electronics industry to make computer hard disks and thermocouples. It can also make LCDs, turbine blades, pacemakers, and dental fillings. Some platinum compounds are used in chemotherapy drugs to treat cancer.\n\nPlatinum has no known biological roles, but is non-toxic as a metal.";

Gold is found free in nature but mainly in conjunction with  silver, quartz (SiO2), calcite (CaCO3), lead, tellurium, zinc or copper. It has been estimated that all gold that has currently been refined could be placed in a cube about 20 meters wide by 20 meters tall by 20 meters long.\n\nBecause gold is so valuable, it is widely used in jewelry along with silver, copper, platinum, and palladium. These alloys are also used in decorative items, coins, and dental fillings. The amount of gold in an alloy is measured with a unit called a karat. A karat is equal to one part gold to twenty-four parts alloy metals. For example, an 18 karat gold ring would contain 18 parts gold and 6 parts other metals.\n\nGold is a good conductor of electricity and heat and does not tarnish when it is exposed to the air, so it can be used to make electrical commectors and printed circuit boards. Gold is also a good reflector of infrared light, so it can be used to shield spacecraft and skyscrapers from the sun's heat, and gold coated mirrors can be used to make telescopes that are sensitive to infrared light. One radioactive isotope of gold, called gold-198, is used for treating cancer, while a compound of gold, called gold sodium thiosulfate (AuNa3O6S4) is used as an arthritis treatment.\n\nGold has no known biological roles, but it is non-toxic.";

Mercury is not found free in nature and is usually obtained from the mineral cinnabar (HgS). Around half of the world's supply of mercury comes from Spain and Italy.\n\nMercury is used to make thermometers, barometers, and other scientific instruments. Its conductivity to electricity is useful in position dependent switches and its vapors are used to make streetlights, fluorescent lamps, and advertising signs. Mercury forms alloys with other metals such ad gold, silver, zinc, and cadmium, but these alloys are known as amalgams. Amalgams are used to extract gold from ores, create dental fillings (with silver), and extend the life of dry cell batteries (with zinc and cadmium). Mercuric chloride (HgCl2), a compound of mercury, is a very poisonous salt that was used for disinfecting ounds, but another compound, mercurous chloride (Hg2Cl2), is used in some other processes for killing bacteria. Other mercury compounds include mercuric sulfide (HgS) and mercuric oxide (HgO), which are respectively used for making a red paint pigment called vermilion and for making mercury batteries.\n\nWhile mercury is present in all living things in some amounts and in every mouthful of food we eat, it is poisonous in high doses and can cause severe illness if too much accumulates in the body. One form of mercury, called methylmercury, is particularly dangerous and can accumulate in the flesh of fish and be eaten by people, making them extremely ill and killing them if they are eaten too much and too often.";

Lead makes up about only 0.0013% of the Earth's crust, but it is not considered a rare earth element because it is easily mined and refined. Almost a third of all lead that is used in the United States is abtained through recycling efforts, while most of the rest is obtained by roasting galena in hot air.\n\nLead gets its chemical symbol from plumbum because the ancient Romans once used lead to make water pipes, some of which are still used today. Unfortunately, lead is a cumulative poison and has been partly blamed for the decline of the Roman empire. Today, lead is used to line tanks that store corrosive liquids such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Lead's high density makes it useful as a shield against X-ray and gamma ray radiation and it is therefore used in X-ray machines and nuclear reactors.

            atomicInfo = "Uranium, named after the planet Uranus, was discovered in the mineral pitchblende, which is primarily a mix of uranium oxides. Although it was believed that the substance that was extracted from pitchblende was pure uranium, it was actually uranium dioxide (UO2). The uranium dioxide was then heated with potassium in a platinum crucible to separate the uranium from the oxygen. Radioactivity was first discovered in a sample of uranium by French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel in 1896. Today, uranium is obtained from pitchblende, uraninite (UO2), carnotite (K2(UO2)2VO4 * 1-3H2O), autunite (Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2 * 10H2O), phosphate rock (Ca3(PO4)2), lignite (brown coal), and monazite sand ((Ce, La, Th, Nd, Y)PO4), although it is ususally sold as diuranate (Na2U2O7·6H2O) or triuranium octoxide (U3O8) because demand for metallic uranium is quite low.\n\nBecause it is naturally radioactive, uranium is most commonly used in the nuclear power industry to generate electricity. There are three isotopes of uranium that exist naturally: uranium-234, uranium-235, and uranium-238, although only uranium-235 is a fissionable material used for nuclear power. When a fissionable material is struck with a neutron, its nucleus releases energy by splitting into smaller fragments. If some of these fragments are other neutrons, they can strike other atoms and cause them to split as well. Uranium-235 is capable of producing enough free neutrons to sustain a nuclear chain reaction.\n\nUnfortunately, only 0.7204% of all naturally occuring uranium is uranium-235. This is too low a concentration to sustain a nuclear chain without help from a material called a moderator, which can slow down a neutron without absorbing it. Slow neutrons are more likely to react with uranium-235 and reactors using natural uranium can be made using graphite or heavy water as moderators. Normal water can be used in place of the moderators after uranium-235 concentrations have increased to roughly 3%.\n\nUranium-238 is uranium's most common and stable isotope, with a half-life of about 4.468 billion years. Uranium-238 decays into thorium-234 via alpha decay. It can be converted into plutonium-239, which can also be used as fuel in nuclear reactors. To produce plutonium-239, uranium-238 atoms are bombarded with neutrons. When uranium-238 absorbs a neutron, it becomes uranium-239, which has a half-life of about 23 minutes and decays into neptunium-239 through beta-minus decay. Neptunium-239's half-life is approximately 2.4 days and decays through beta-minus decay into plutonium-239.\n\nUranium has few uses outside of the nuclear power industry. It is used as a target for X-ray production, as ammunition for some types of military weaponry, as a shield against radiation, as a counterweight for aircraft control surfaces, and in gyroscopes for internal guidance systems. For centuries, it has been used to color glass yellow. There is a 2,00 year old sample of yellow glass near Naples, Italy, that contains uranium oxide. Uranium trioxide (UO3) is an orange powder and has been used in the manufacture of Fiestaware plates. Other uranium compounds have also been used to make vaseline glass and glazes, but the uranium within these items is radioactive and should be handled carefully.\n\nAs uranium is a radioactive substance, its health effects have been researched thoroughly. When people are exposed to uranium radionuclides that are formed during radioactive decay for long periods of time, they may develop cancer. When people are exposed to enriched uranium, the chances of getting cancer are much higher because it is more radioactive. Enriched uranium may end up in the environment during accidents in nuclear power plants such as the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, where at least 5% of the radioactive reactor core was released into the environment and spread throughout many parts of Europe after a steam explosion damaged the reactor.";

After about 1,080 hours calcium-48 irradiation, the result was three oganesson atoms and three free neutrons.\n\nOganesson-294, the isotope that resulted from the irradiation, is also oganesson's most stable isotope, with a half-life of 0.89 milliseconds. It decays into livermorium-290 through alpha decay.\n\nOnly a few atoms of oganesson have ever been made, so it has no uses outside of research.";
