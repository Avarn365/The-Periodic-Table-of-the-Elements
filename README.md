# The-Periodic-Table-of-the-Elements
This is a program I created in Unity that lists and describes all of the elements of the Periodic Table. It is based on an HTML project I did in college that I unfortunately no longer have. In this program, you have a slider at the top of the Explore section that lets you read about a different element whenever you move it left or right. Along with the element's info, you will find its atomic number, atomic mass, melting point, boiling point, room temperature state, density, ionization energy, where you can locate the element on the Periodic Table and more. Once you have read about these elements, you can put your knowledge to the test by going to the Quiz section of the application. There, you answer true/false questions as you work your way up to $1,000,000. I even have a Sources section that lists the websites I got the information about the elements from.
